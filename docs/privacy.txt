Privacy Policy
Last Updated: April 10, 2025
CommSync (“we,” “us,” or “our”) provides this Privacy Policy to explain our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit the CommSync website at https://commsync.gg (the “Site”), register an account with CommSync, or use any of our related applications, services, or software (collectively, “CommSync” or the “Service”).
By accessing or using CommSync, registering an account, or visiting our Site, you consent to the terms and practices described in this Policy. We reserve the right to update this Policy at any time by posting a revised version on this page, clearly indicating the date of the most recent changes. We encourage you to review this Policy regularly.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at commsync@havenmediasolutions.com.
At CommSync, we take your privacy seriously. We continuously strive to protect your data and maintain a platform you can trust.


1. What Data Do We Collect?
We collect three main categories of information:
1. Information you choose to give us

2. Information we get when you use our Services

3. Information we receive from third parties

Below is more detail on each category:
   1. Account and Registration Information

      * When you create an account or use CommSync, we may collect personal information such as your name, username, email address, phone number, date of birth, profile photo, mailing address, payment information, and any other information you choose to provide.

      * In some cases, you may log in through a third-party provider (e.g., a social media or identity management service). In these cases, information shared with CommSync is subject to that third party’s separate terms and privacy policy.

         2. Communications Data

            * CommSync integrates various messaging channels—including emails, phone services (e.g., JustCall, WhatsApp), social media (e.g., Instagram DMs), and other communication platforms (e.g., Discord)—to unify your conversations in one place.

            * When you connect these accounts to CommSync, you authorize us to securely access, process, and store messages and related data (such as contact lists) to provide the Service effectively.

            * We store only the data necessary to deliver the fastest experience and essential features. We may delete older messages from our servers after a certain period, and CommSync is not intended to serve as a permanent archive.

               3. Automatic Data Collection

                  * Log Data: Our servers automatically record information sent by your browser when you visit the Site. This may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, device identifiers, the pages or features of CommSync you use, and the times you access or use CommSync.

                  * Cookies: We use cookies to remember user preferences and enhance user experience. Session cookies help us understand how you interact with CommSync, and persistent cookies store your username and login password for convenient future access. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but some functionality may become limited as a result.

                     4. Active Communications

                        * When you communicate with us directly (e.g., through email, support tickets, or surveys), we may collect and store the details of your communication, including your contact information and any other personal information you choose to share.

                           5. Google API Data

                              * CommSync’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the “Limited Use” requirements.



2. How Do We Use the Data That We Collect?
We use the collected information for the following purposes:
                                 1. Providing and Managing Our Services

                                    * To operate CommSync, authenticate users, process transactions, troubleshoot issues, and offer customer support.

                                    * This processing is necessary to perform our contract with you or to fulfill legitimate interests in providing and improving the Service.

                                       2. Communication and Marketing

                                          * To send you newsletters, promotions, special offers, product updates, or other communications about CommSync’s features. You can opt out of receiving such communications at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” in an email or contacting us at commsync@havenmediasolutions.com.

                                          * We may send you additional marketing messages only with your consent (which you can withdraw at any time).

                                             3. Compliance with Legal Obligations

                                                * We may process your information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests.

                                                   4. Business Interests

                                                      * To better understand how users interact with CommSync and to ensure a secure, effective, and personalized experience.

                                                      * To improve, develop, and protect CommSync’s features and capabilities (e.g., bug fixes, new features).

                                                      * To conduct analytics and support internal operations that help us refine our marketing and communication strategies.

                                                         5. Data Anonymization

                                                            * We may anonymize, de-identify, or aggregate data for internal business purposes or to share with third parties (e.g., statistics, usage patterns). This data cannot be used to identify you.

We do not rent, sell, or monetize your personal data. CommSync also does not serve ads based on your personal information.


3. How Is Information Disclosed?
We will only disclose your information in the following circumstances:
                                                               1. With Your Consent

                                                                  * We may share or disclose your information if you explicitly request or authorize us to do so.

                                                                     2. Compliance with Law or Protection of Rights

                                                                        * We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, legal process, or governmental request. We may also share information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of CommSync, our users, or the public.

                                                                           3. Service Providers and Affiliates

                                                                              * We employ third parties to facilitate CommSync’s functionality (e.g., hosting services, payment processing). These third-party service providers have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and must comply with this Privacy Policy.

                                                                              * We may share data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies for internal administrative purposes consistent with this Policy.

                                                                                 4. Business Transfers

                                                                                    * If CommSync is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to the acquirer’s or successor entity’s adherence to this Privacy Policy (or a policy with substantially similar protections).

                                                                                       5. Aggregate and De-Identified Information

4. Links and Third-Party Service Providers
CommSync or our Site may contain links to websites or services operated by third parties. We do not control these third-party services, nor are we responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to read each site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.


5. Data Retention
We retain personal data for as long as needed to provide our Services or as required by law. The specific duration may vary based on factors like legal requirements or the scope of your active user relationship with CommSync.
                                                                                             * Payment Information: If you choose to store payment details for subscription services, those details are managed securely by our payment provider (e.g., Stripe) and retained only as necessary for billing and dispute resolution.

                                                                                             * Deletion Requests: If you request deletion of your data, we will fulfill that request in accordance with applicable laws and our contractual obligations. Some minimal data (e.g., basic account identifiers) may be retained to prevent further unwanted processing.



6. How Is Information Secured?
We employ industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. However, no system is entirely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
                                                                                                * Encryption: Data sent and received through CommSync is secured via TLS/SSL encryption. Stored data may also be encrypted at rest using the AES-256 standard.

                                                                                                * Regular Security Measures: We apply patches regularly and conduct periodic external security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.



7. Our Policy Toward Minors
CommSync is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under 13. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe we might have information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at commsync@havenmediasolutions.com.


8. International Processing or Transfer
Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside of your local jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. By using CommSync, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to and from the United States (or any other country in which we operate), in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
