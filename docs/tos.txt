User Terms and Conditions
Last Updated: April 10, 2025
Welcome to CommSync. The following User Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) describe how you may use the CommSync mobile apps, websites, services, and software (collectively, “CommSync” or the “Services”), provided to you by CommSync (“we,” “us,” or “our”).
Please read these Terms carefully. They apply to anyone who accesses or uses CommSync (“users,” “you,” or “your”). By using CommSync, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by the terms of our [Privacy Policy], which explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.
If you use CommSync on behalf of a group, organization, or company, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms (in which case, “you” and “your” refer to that entity).
1. What is CommSync
CommSync is a unified communications platform that integrates multiple messaging and communication channels in one place. You may link your email provider(s), phone services (e.g., JustCall, WhatsApp), social media messaging (e.g., Instagram DMs), and other channels (e.g., Discord) so that all messages from a single lead or customer appear in one thread.
1. When you add your accounts (email, phone, or other platforms) to CommSync, you authorize us to securely access, process, and temporarily store your messages and related data, as necessary to provide the Services.

2. CommSync may securely store certain credentials to provide you with continuous integration, or use secure authentication methods offered by the respective service providers to avoid storing your passwords whenever possible.

3. We may keep data temporarily on our servers to deliver CommSync’s features (for example, storing recent messages or conversation histories). Although we strive to maintain reliable storage, you understand that we may delete or archive older messages after a certain period and that CommSync is not intended to be a permanent archive of your communications.

2. User Obligations
By signing up to use CommSync, you agree to:
   1. Provide Accurate Information. You will keep your account information accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

   2. Safeguard Your Account. You are responsible for all activity under your CommSync account and for protecting any passwords or other credentials you use to access CommSync.

   3. Follow the Law. You will use CommSync only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. You represent that you can form a legally binding contract where you reside.

You further agree not to:
      * Violate Applicable Laws or Regulations. Don’t violate any local, state, national, or international law while using CommSync.

      * Breach Privacy or Defame Others. Don’t violate others’ privacy rights, defame, or disparage anyone.

      * Interfere with Services. Don’t interfere with or disrupt CommSync or its servers and networks, or circumvent any security or authentication measures.

      * Access Another User’s Account. Don’t attempt to access an account not belonging to you without explicit permission.

      * Reverse Engineer or Resell. Don’t copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or otherwise exploit CommSync’s software or features for any unauthorized commercial purpose.

      * Send Malware or Spam. Don’t send viruses, malicious code, or unsolicited spam through CommSync.

      * Provide Misleading or Deceptive Information. Don’t impersonate someone else or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.

Violation of these obligations may result in suspension or termination of your access to CommSync without notice or liability. Termination of your account or cessation of your use of the Services does not relieve you of obligations you incurred under these Terms.


3. Security and Privacy
We value your privacy and the security of your data. Please review our [Privacy Policy] to learn about the information we collect and how we protect it.
However, no platform or service can guarantee absolute security. You acknowledge that you provide and transmit data via CommSync at your own risk, and that unauthorized third parties may, despite our best efforts, defeat our security measures.


4. Software and License
         1. License Grant. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to install and use CommSync’s software for your personal or internal business use.

         2. Upgrades. We may release updates or new versions of CommSync from time to time. These Terms govern any such upgrades or versions, unless we specify otherwise.

         3. Third-Party Code. CommSync may include open-source or third-party software, which remains subject to its own license terms.



5. CommSync’s Content and Intellectual Property
We own all rights, title, and interest in and to CommSync, including but not limited to our patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, design elements, software, logos, and trade secrets (“CommSync Rights”).
            * Nothing in these Terms grants you the right to use our trademarks, logos, domain names, or branding.

            * You may provide us with feedback or suggestions, and you agree that we can use or share such feedback at any time without compensation or recognition to you.



6. Your Content and Data
               1. Definition of User Data. “User Data” includes any messages, information, files, images, attachments, or other content you upload, submit, or transmit through CommSync.

               2. Your Ownership. You retain any intellectual property rights in and to your User Data. CommSync does not claim ownership of your User Data.

               3. Permissions to CommSync. By using CommSync, you grant us the limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to (i) store and process your User Data as necessary to provide the Services, (ii) transmit or display your User Data to you or third parties at your direction, and (iii) sublicense these rights to trusted third parties who help us operate CommSync (e.g., hosting providers).

               4. Your Responsibility. You are solely responsible for User Data transmitted or stored through CommSync. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to provide such User Data to us.

                  * You are responsible for any content you share through CommSync.

                  * We comply with applicable intellectual property laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

                  * We reserve the right to remove or disable content alleged to be infringing and to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.



8. Representations and Warranties
CommSync is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our licensors disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that CommSync will be error-free, uninterrupted, secure, or free of viruses or harmful components. You use CommSync at your own risk.


9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law:
                     * We and our affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business) arising out of or in connection with your use of CommSync.

                     * Our total liability for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms or CommSync shall not exceed the amounts you have paid us (if any) for CommSync in the three (3) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so these limitations may not apply to you.


10. Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:
                        1. Your use or misuse of CommSync;

                        2. Your violation of these Terms;

                        3. Your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property or privacy right;

                        4. Any User Data submitted through your account;

                        5. Any other party’s access to or use of CommSync through your account or credentials.



11. Changes and Modifications
We continuously improve and evolve CommSync. We may modify or remove features at any time, and we may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date above or notify you by other means. Your continued use of CommSync after any such update constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree with any updates, you must stop using CommSync.


12. Notifications
We may provide notices to you by email, via CommSync, or by posting on our website. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users. You are responsible for keeping your account information current so that you receive these notices.


13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to CommSync will be governed by the laws of the state of Mississippi, without regard to its conflict-of-laws principles. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or CommSync must be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts.


14. Miscellaneous
                           1. Entire Agreement. These Terms, together with any other policies referenced herein (such as the [Privacy Policy]), constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to CommSync.

                           2. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. These Terms do not create any rights for or in favor of any third parties.

                           3. Waiver and Severability. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to do so later. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain fully enforceable, and a substitute provision reflecting our intent will be applied.

                           4. Assignment. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may freely assign these Terms.

                           5. Relationship. You and CommSync are independent contractors; these Terms do not establish any partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship.
